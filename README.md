If you are seeing this on the GitHub page, then read on.

If you do not have Jupyter, Python, etc., installed on your computer, you can use these 
Jupyter notebooks directly in your browser. Load JupyterLite by clicking on the following link:

➡️ **https://jmshea.github.io/digicom-jupyter**

Then double click on notebooks in the left-hand file palette to load them into JupyterLite.
As with Jupyter, use shift-Enter to run cells.
